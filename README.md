What is React?
React is:

A JavaScript library created by Facebook.
A User Interface (UI) library.
A tool for building UI components.
Who made React?
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook). He released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS." He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.

What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript. It allows you to use the newest features of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015). React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.

How does Babel convert HTML code in React into valid code?
Babel converts HTML-like JSX syntax used in React components into valid JavaScript code that can be executed in preferred browsers. It does this by converting JSX code into JavaScript functions that return the same HTML-like structures. This enables the usage of JSX in React apps and ensures compatibility with outdated browsers that might not support the most recent JavaScript syntax.

What is ReactDOM used for?
ReactDOM is used to render components and elements on the web. It is a part of the React library used to create user interfaces and dynamic web applications, as well as reusable and composable components that can be used in different applications.

Packages Needed for React Development
To work with React, you typically need to import several packages and dependencies. Some of the key ones include:

React
ReactDOM
Babel (optional)
React Router (optional)
State Management Library (optional)
Styling Libraries (optional)
Axios or Fetch (optional)
PropTypes (optional)
Development Tools (optional)
How to Add React to a Web Application
To add React to a web application:

Set up a development environment with Node.js and npm.
Create a new React application using npx create-react-app.
Navigate to your React app's directory.
Start the development server with npm start.
Edit and build your React app by creating components and features.
Use ReactDOM to render your top-level component into the HTML root element.
Add more components, styles, routing, state management, and API integration as needed.
Test and debug your application.
When ready, build your app for production with npm run build.
Deploy the production build to a web server or hosting service.
What is React.createElement?
React.createElement is a function used in React to create React elements, which represent the structure and content of the user interface. It takes three properties: type, props, and children, and it's used to describe what you want to render on the screen.

Meaning of Render and Root in React

Render: It refers to the process of displaying React components on the web page by updating the DOM to reflect the current state of your application.
Root: In React, it typically refers to an HTML element where your React application is mounted and rendered. It's the entry point for your React app in the DOM.
